# Pinclone-Beta

Pinclone is an attempt to create clone of Pinterest using Python 3.4/Django 1.10.

In this web app you can follow users, create boards, upload pins by yourself or pin images from
boards of other users, like pins, use newsfeed and do some other stuff and what exactly you can check out in repository.

Currently I'm working on frontend part.
